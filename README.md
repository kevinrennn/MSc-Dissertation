# MSc Dissertation
This repository contains my dissertation for the MSc in Applied Social Data Science at LSE ([LSE_MSc_Dissertation.pdf](LSE_MSc_Dissertation.pdf)), along with reproducible `R` scripts in the subfolder [Code](Code). 

The [Code](Code) subfolder currently contains only scripts used to run the word embedding analysis. Scripts I used for cleaning the corpus and calculating sentiment time-series are available upon request.
