# MSc Dissertation
This repository contains my dissertation for the MSc in Applied Social Data Science at LSE ([LSE_MSc_Dissertation.pdf](LSE_MSc_Dissertation.pdf)). 

I use automated dictionary-based sentiment analysis to examine the relationship between inﬂation-related news coverage and inﬂation expectations over a 60-year period. I also use word embedding, an emerging technique in natural language processing, to show that semantic associations of the word “inﬂation” (as used in the news) have shifted quite dramatically in the periods before and after the Volcker disinﬂation. 

The analysis is based on a rare corpus of *New York Times* economic news articles dating back to 1947 and was done using the `quanteda` and `word2vec` packages in `R`. Reproducible scripts for the word embedding analysis are located in the subfolder [Code](Code). (Scripts I used for cleaning the corpus and calculating the sentiment and volume time-series are available upon request.)
